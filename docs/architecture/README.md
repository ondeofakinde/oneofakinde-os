## Source Basis

Primary source of truth is `oneofakinde-os_2026-surface map_021626.txt` (dated 2026-02-16). Supporting visual direction is derived from:

- `oneofakinde_brand_design_rules_manual_v2026.pdf`
- `oneofakinde-os_look and feel.pages`
- `oneofakinde_system reference_01.pdf`
- `oneofakinde_system reference_02.pdf`

## Notes

The two `system reference` PDFs are image-heavy with no recoverable text layer in this execution environment. Their first-page visuals were reviewed and incorporated as directional context only; hard behavioral rules are anchored to the 2026 surface map.
